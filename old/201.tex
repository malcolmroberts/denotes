\section*{Introduction}

Differential equations (abbreviated DEs) are equations involving functions and
their derivatives. For example,
\be \label{eg1}
\dd{y}{x} =y
\ee
is a differential equation. In this case, $y$ is a function of the independent
variable $x$, and we would like to determine $y$. The solution to this
equation is
\bee
y = Ce^x,
\eee
with $C$ an arbitrary constant, since $y'=\dd{}{x}Ce^x=Ce^x=y$. That is, if we
plug $y=Ce^x$ into equation (\ref{eg1}), both sides match. If we modify this
a little bit, say letting $y=Ce^x +x$, then the left hand side doesn't
match the right:
\bee
\dd{y}{x} = \dd{}{x}(Ce^x +x) = Ce^x + 1 = y +1 \neq y,
\eee
so it isn't a solution to equation (\ref{eg1}).

An initial value problem (abbreviated as IVP) is a differential equation
combined with one or more initial conditions. For example,
\bee
\dd{y}{x}=y, \qquad y(0)=1
\eee
is an initial value problem.
The differential equation is solved by $y=Ce^x$, for any value of $C$. However,
the only way to satisfy $y(0)=Ce^0=1$ is to set $C=1$. That is, the solution
to the initial value problem is $y=e^x$, since it satisfies both the
differential equation and the initial conditions.

Differential equations are extremely useful for modelling complex behaviour in
most sciences. Unfortunately, we do not know how to solve most
differential equations analytically, and in practice we often have to
make approximations when dealing with real systems. However, when we can solve
DEs analytically, we should, and understanding how to solve simple DEs will
help to understand the properties of solutions of more complicated problems.



\chapter{Separable and Exact DEs}


\section{Separable equations}

Separable equations are differential equations of the form
\be \label{separable}
\boxed{h(y) \dd{y}{x} = g(x)}.
\ee
These are simple to solve: from equation (\ref{separable}), we can just split
the derivative and integrate: $ h(y)\, dy = g(x) \, dx$ becomes
\bee
\boxed{  \int h(y) \, dy = \int g(x) \, dx},
\eee
and then all we need to do is find the integral and solve for $y$.\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Consider the equation
\be \label{separableexample}
  y \dd{y}{x} = \sin(x)
\ee
with initial condition $ y(0) = 1$. Separating and integrating yields
\bee
  \int y \, dy = \int \sin(x) \, dx
  \qquad \implies \qquad
  \frac{y^2}{2} = -\cos(x) + C
\eee
where $C$ is a constant that will be determined by the initial conditions.
Let us now solve for $y$:
\bee
  y(x) = \pm \sqrt{2 C -2 \cos(x)}.
\eee
Notice that we have two different solutions a positive one and a negative on.
 We can use the initial condition $y(0)=1$ to eliminate one. Since
\bee
  y(0) = \pm  \sqrt{2 C - 2 \cos(0) } = \pm \sqrt{2C-2} =1,
\eee
and $1$ is positive, we must choose the positive root.
Thus,
\bee
\(C-1\)^2 =1/2
\quad \implies \quad
C=3/2
\quad \implies \quad
y(x) = \sqrt{3 - 2\cos(x)}.
\eee

It's a good idea to check that the solution that you got is correct. This is
pretty easy; just plug the solution into the original equation. From
the above example, $y(x) = 2 \sqrt{\frac{3}{2} - \cos(x)}$, so
\bee
  \dd{y}{x} = \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{3 -2 \cos(x)}}.
\eee
Putting this into equation (\ref{separableexample}) yields
\bee
  y \dd{y}{x}=
  \(\sqrt{3 - 2\cos(x)}\) \times \(\frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{3 -2 \cos(x)}}\)
  = \sin(x)
\eee
so we can be sure that we got the correct answer. \qed



\section{Exact Equations}

\begin{definition}\emph{Exact equations.}
Homogeneous first-order differential equations can be written in the form
$M(x,y) dx + N(x,y)dy=0.$ If
\be
  \boxed{\pp{M(x,y)}{y} =   \pp{N(x,y)}{x}}
\ee
then the equation is called \emph{exact}.
\end{definition}
The nice thing with exact differentials is that Poincare's lemma implies
the existence of a function $F$ such that $dF = M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy$, and
$dF$, called the differential of $F$, can be thought of as ``how much $F$
changes''. Since $dF=0$, $F$ does not change, i.e.\ it's constant.
Solutions to the exact differential equation are given
implicitly by $F(x,y)=\text{constant}$.

Exact equations are straightforward to solve: after a little bit of trickery,
we simply integrate. Let
\be \label{exactsol}
\boxed{  F(x,y) = \int M(x,y) dx + g(y) }.
\ee
We require that $\pp{}{y}F(x,y)= N(x,y)$, which will allow us to determine
$g(y)$. That is,
\bee
  \pp{F(x,y)}{y}
  &=& \pp{}{y}\(\int M(x,y) dx + g(y)\)
  \\
  &=& \int \pp{M(x,y)}{y} dx + \pp{g(y)}{y}
  \\
  &=& N(x,y) + g'(y).
\eee
This tells us what $g'(y)$ is, so we now know $g(y)$ up to some constant
$C$. We can put this into equation (\ref{exactsol}), which gives us the
implicit solution
\be \label{exactimpl}
\boxed{F(x,y) =C }.
\ee
In many cases, we can solve for $y$, thus getting an explicit solution
$y=f(x)$ so that $F(x,f(x))=C$, but sometimes all we have for a solution
is something in the form of equation (\ref{exactimpl}).\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Solve
\bee
  y\, dx + \(y^2 + x \) dy =0
\eee
Using the notation above, we have $M(x,y)=y$, and $N(x,y)=y^2 +x$.
This equation is exact, since
\bee
  \dd{}{y}y = 1 = \dd{\(y^2 +x\)}{x}.
\eee
So write
\bee
  F(x,y)
  = \int y dx + g(y)
  = xy + g(y).
\eee
We now need to set $\pp{}{y} F = N$, so
\bee
  \pp{}{y}\[xy + g(y)\] = y^2 +x
\eee
which implies that $g'(y) = y^2$. We integrate this to get
\be \label{exactC1}
  g(y) = \frac{y^3}{3} + C.
\ee
The solution is then given by
\be \label{exactC2}
  F(x,y) = xy + \frac{y^3}{3} =C. \qed
\ee
(Note that in the above equation we have played fast and loose with the
undetermined constant $C$; in fact, $C$ changed sign between equation
(\ref{exactC1}) and equation (\ref{exactC2}). We perform this abuse of notation
because $C$ is \emph{undetermined}, so there's not much point nailing it
down to a value until the very last moment.)

\section{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Does $y = \sqrt{3-2\sin x}$ solve the differential equation
  \bee
  y\frac{dy}{dx}=\sin(x)?
  \eee

\item
  Solve the equation
  \bee
  (2xy + 3) dx + (x^2 - 1) dy = 0
  \eee
  \hidesolution{This is an exact equation}

\item
  Solve the logistic map $\dd{y}{x} = y - y^2$ as a separable equation.

\item
  Give the general solution to the differential equation
  \bee
  \ddt{y} = 1 + \frac{1}{y^2}
  \eee
  \hidesolution{
    This is a separable equation:
    \bee
    \frac{dy}{1+\frac{1}{y^2}} = dt
    \implies
    \int dt = \int  \frac{dy}{1+\frac{1}{y^2}}
    \eee
    But, since
    \bee
    \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{y^2}} = \frac{y^2}{y^2+1} = 1 - \frac{1}{1+y^2}
    \eee
    so
    \bee
    t = \int  \(1 - \frac{1}{1+y^2}\) dy = y + \arctan y + C,
    \eee
    which implicitly defines $y(t)$.
  }

\end{enumerate}



\chapter{Linear Equations and Transformations}

\section{Linear Equations}

Linear equations have the form
\be \label{linear}
\boxed{\dd{y}{x} + P(x) y = Q(x)}.
\ee
To solve these equations, we use an \emph{integrating factor}. That is, if
we define the integrating factor $\mu$ as
\be
\boxed{\mu(x) \doteq \exp\[ \int P(x) d x \]},
\ee
then notice that
\bee
  \dd{}{x}\(\mu y \) = \dd{\mu}{x} y + \mu \dd{y}{x}
  = \mu P(x) y + \mu \dd{y}{x}.
\eee
So if we multiply equation \eqref{linear} by $\mu$, we get
\be
\boxed{  \dd{}{x}\(\mu y \) = \mu Q},
\ee
which we can now solve by taking the integral of both sides with respect to
$x$. Doing this, we get
\bee
  d\(\mu y\) = \mu Q dx \qquad \implies \qquad
  \mu y = \int \mu Q dx + C
\eee
which gives the general formula
\be
\label{linearf}
\boxed{y = \frac{\int \mu Q dx + C}{\mu}}.
\ee
\\

\noindent \emph{Example}:
\label{linearsec}
Consider the equation
\bee
  \dd{y}{x} + \frac{y}{x} = 2 e^x.
\eee
We identify $P(x)=1/x$ and $Q(x)=2e^x$. The integrating factor is
\bee
  \mu(x) = \mbox{exp}\[\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx \] = e^{\ln x} = x.
\eee
Then,
\be \label{linearex}
  \dd{}{x} \(x y \) = 2 x e^x
  \quad \implies \quad
  x y = \int 2 x e^x \, dx.
\ee
From the formula (equation \eqref{linearf}), we have
\be
\label{linearexx}
y = \frac{\int \mu Q dx + C}{\mu} = \frac{\int 2 x e^x \, dx + C}{x}.
\ee
To solve this, we use integration by parts. That is,
$\int u \, dv = uv - \int v\,  du$. We choose $u=x$ and $dv = e^x \, dx$, so
$du = dx$, and $v=e^x$. Thus,
\bee
  \int x e^x \,dx = x e^x + \int e^x \,dx = x e^x + e^x.
\eee
Putting this into equation \eqref{linearexx} yields
\bee
  y = 2 e^x \(1 + \frac{1}{x}\) + \frac{C}{x}. \qed
\eee
We can now use the initial conditions to determine the value of $C$.


% TODO: show how they can check this?



\section{Equations that can be solved via substitution}

Sometimes it is possible to make a substitution to transform a differential
equation into something that we already know how to solve. This can be a very
powerful technique. Unfortunately, each type of equation needs its own
particular substitution and this makes substitution not as straight forward as
other techniques.

\subsubsection{Homogeneous Equations}
\be
\boxed{\dd{y}{x} = f\(\frac{y}{x}\)}.
\ee
We solve this by substituting $v=y/x$, so that
\bee
\dd{y}{x} = v + x \dd{v}{x},
\quad \implies \quad
v + x \dd{v}{x} = f(v),
\eee
which can be written as the separable equation
\bee
\boxed{\dd{v}{x} = \frac{f(v) -v}{x}}.
\eee

\noindent \emph{Example}:
\bee
\dd{y}{x} = \frac{x}{y}, \mbox{ with } y(1) = 2.
\eee
This is homogeneous, so let $v=y/x$, and then $f(v) = \frac{1}{v}$, so
\bee
v + x \dd{v}{x} = \frac{1}{v}
\quad \implies \quad
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{v} -v} dv = \frac{1}{x}dx.
\eee
Integrating both sides gives
\bee
\int \frac{v}{1-v^2}dv = \int \frac{1}{x} dx
\quad \implies \quad
-\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u}du = \ln x+ \ln C
\eee
where we have used the substitution $u = 1-v^2$. Thus,
\bee
\ln\(1-v^2 \) = \ln \frac{C}{x^2}
\eee
which implies that
\bee
v = \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{C}{x^2}}
\quad \implies \quad
y = \pm x \sqrt{1 - \frac{C}{x^2}}.
\eee
The initial condition is $y(1)=2$, so we choose the positive root, and
find $C$ by setting $x=1$, $y=2$, i.e.\
\bee
2 = 1 \times \sqrt{1-C}
\quad \implies \quad
C=-3
\quad \implies \quad
y = x \sqrt{1 + \frac{3}{x^2}}.
\eee

This would be a good one to check. Note that
\bee
\dd{y}{x} = \sqrt{1+\frac{3}{x^2}} - \frac{3/x^2}{\sqrt{1+\frac{3}{x^2}}}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{3}{x^2}}}
= \frac{x}{y},
\eee
so the solution is correct. \qed

\subsubsection{Bernoulli Equations}
Bernoulli equations are differential equations of the form
\bee
\dd{y}{x} + P(x) y = Q(x)y^n
\eee
where $n$ can be an integer or a rational number. Note that if
$n=0$ or $n=1$, then this is just a linear equation.

We solve this by substituting $v=y^{1-n}$, so that
\bee
\dd{v}{x} = \(1-n\)y^{-n}\dd{y}{x}
\quad \implies \quad
\frac{1}{1-n} \dd{v}{x} + P(x)v = Q(x),
\eee
which can be written as the linear equation
\be
\boxed{\dd{v}{x} + (1-n)P(x)v = (1-n)Q(x)}.
\ee

\noindent\emph{Example}:
\bee
\dd{y}{x} -\half \frac{y}{x} = -e^x y^3
\eee
Since $n=3$, choose $v=y^{-2}$. Then
\bee
\dd{v}{x} = -2 y^{-3} \dd{y}{x}
\quad \implies \quad
\dd{v}{x} = -2 y^{-3}\( \half \frac{y}{x}  - e^x y^3\)
\quad \implies \quad
\dd{v}{x} + \frac{v}{x} = 2 e^x,
\eee
which is the linear equation given as the example from section \ref{linearsec}.
\qed


%\subsubsection{Equations with Linear Coefficients}
% Question: doesn't case 1 follow from case 2?
% Sam's answer: Yes, I believe it does
%\be
%\(a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1\)dx +2 \(a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2\)dy =0
%\ee
%We deal with equations where $a_1 b_2 \neq a_2 b_1$, for which there
%are two cases:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item if $c_1=c_2=0$, then
%\be
%\dd{y}{x} = -\frac{a_1 + b_1 \(y/x\)}{a_2+ b_2 \(y/x\)},
%\ee
%which is homogeneous.
%\item if either $c_1$ or $c_2$ is not zero, then we use the substitution
%$x=u+h$ and $y=v+k$, with $h$ and $k$ constants which obey the relationship
%\be
%a_1h + b_1 k + c_1 &=&0 \\ \nonumber
%a_2h + b_2 k + c_2 &=&0 .
%\ee
%This reduces the problem to
%\be
%\dd{v}{u} = -\frac{a_1 + b_1 \(v/u\)}{a_2 + b_2 \(v/u\)},
%\ee
%which is homogeneous in $u$ and $v$.
%\end{enumerate}

\section{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
% a linear equation
Solve the initial value problem
\bee
&&\qquad(x^2 + 1) \frac{dy}{dx} + 4xy = 4x \\ \nonumber
&&y(0) =\ 0\ \text{ or }\ 1\ \mbox{ (choose one, and circle your choice)}
\eee
\hidesolution{Rewrite this equation as
\bee
\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{4x}{x^2+1}y = \frac{4x}{x^2+1}
\eee
which is linear with $P(x) = \frac{4x}{x^2+1}$, so let
\bee
\mu(x) = \exp \left(\int P(x)dx \right)
= \exp \left( \int \frac{4x}{x^2+1} dx \right) = \exp(2 \ln (x^2+1))
= \exp(\ln (x^2+1)^2) = (x^2+1)^2.
\eee
(Note that we can omit the absolute value bars around $x^2+1$ since it is
always positive.) Then multiplying through by $\mu(x)$ we obtain
\bee
(x+1)^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + 4x(x^2+1)y &=& 4x(x^2+1) \\
\frac{d}{dx} \left( (x^2+1)y \right) &=& 4x^3+4x. \\
\eee
Integrating yields
\bee
(x^2+1)^2 y &=& x^4 + 2x^2 + C \\
y &=& \frac{x^4 + 2x^2 + C}{(x^2+1)^2}.
\eee
Solving the IVP $y(0) = 1$ gives $C = 1$, then the solution is
\bee
y = \frac{x^4 + 2x^2 + 1}{(x^2+1)^2} = \frac{(x^2+1)^2}{(x^2+1)^2} \equiv 1.
\eee
It's actually obvious from just looking at the problem that $y \equiv 1$ is a
solution to this IVP, so you could just have wrote it down and quoted the
result that linear equations have unique solutions to IVPs.

This equation is also separable since we may rewrite it as
\bee
(x^2+1) \frac{dy}{dx}
= 4x(1-y) \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{1}{1-y} \frac{dy}{dx}
= \frac{4x}{x^2+1}
\eee
but in dividing by $1-y$ we have destroyed the solution $y \equiv 1$, which
is the (unique) solution to the initial value problem $y(0) = 1$, so it is
not possible to solve the IVP $y(0) = 1$ by separating this equation.  This
is why I let you choose instead the IVP $y(0) = 0$, which has solution
\bee
y = 1 - \frac{1}{(x^2+1)^2}

\chapter{Second-order Linear Equations}
% Text chapter 4.2
Let $a,b,c$ be real numbers. Second order equations of the form
\be \label{sec2hom}
a \ddtwo{y}{t} + b \dd{y}{t} + cy =0
\ee
are linear in $y$. If both $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions to
equation (\eqref{sec2hom}), and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants, then
\newcommand\ycomb{\alpha y_1 + \beta y_2}

&& a \ddtwo{\(\ycomb\)}{t} + b \dd{\(\ycomb\)}{t} + c \(\ycomb \)

+\beta\(a \ddtwo{y_2}{t} + b \dd{y_2}{t} + cy_2 \)

&&= \alpha \(0\) +\beta \(0\) =0,
\eee
In other words, $\ycomb$, which is a linear combination of $y_1$ and $y_2$, is
also a solution to equation (\ref{sec2hom}). Being able to use this linearity
is a powerful tool that we can use to solve this very important type of
differential equation. We will, in general, have two solutions to these
second-order differential equations, and we will need two initial values to
fully determine the solution. This is expressed in the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
  Let $b$, $c$, $Y_0$, and $Y_1 \in \mathbb{R}$.
  Then, the initial value problem
  \bee
  y'' + by' + cy =0, \qquad y(0)=Y_0, \quad y'(0)=Y_1
  \eee
  has a unique solution.

\section{Homogeneous Linear Equations}
The behaviour of these systems is basically exponential. To see this,
set $y=e^{rt}$. Then, putting this into equation (\ref{sec2hom}), we get
\bee
a r^2 e^{rt} + b r e^{rt} + ce^{rt}
= e^{rt} \( ar^2 + br + c\) =0.
\eee
Since $e^{rt}$ is never zero, there is no harm in dividing by it. This leaves
us with the \emph{characteristic equation},
\be
\boxed{ar^2 + br + c =0},
\ee
which allows us to determine $r$ using the quadratic formula. In this way
we get two solutions,
\bee
\boxed{y_1=e^{r_1 t}\text{ and }y_2=e^{r_2 t}},
\eee
from the two solutions $r_1$ and $r_2$ of the characteristic equation.\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Solve the second-order homogeneous equation
\bee
\ddtwo{y}{t} - y =0,
\eee
with initial conditions $y(0) =1, \, y'(0) =0.$\\
\noindent\emph{Solution}:
Setting $y=e^{rt}$, this becomes
\bee
e^{rt} \(r^2 -1 \) = e^{rt} \(r-1\)\(r+1\) =0,
\eee
so $r_1=-1$, and $r_2=1$. Thus,
\bee
y_1(t) = e^{-t}, \qquad y_2(t) =e^t.
\eee
The solution $y$ is therefore a linear combination of $y_1$ and $y_2$. That is,
\bee
y(t) = \alpha y_1(t) + \beta y_2(t) = \alpha e^{-t} + \beta e^t,
\eee
for some constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that are determined by the initial
conditions. Since $y(0)=1$,
\bee \label{sec2ab1}
y(0) = \alpha +\beta =1.
\eee
Since $y'(0)=0$, and $y'(t) = -\alpha e^{-t} + \beta e^t$,
\be \label{sec2ab2}
y'(0) = -\alpha + \beta =0.
\ee
Combining equations \eqref{sec2ab1} and \eqref{sec2ab2}, it is easy to see
that $\alpha = \beta =\half$. The solution is therefore
\bee
y = \frac{e^{-t} + e^t}{2}. \qed
\eee

\section{Dealing with complex roots}
%Text section 4.3
So far, we've seen only problems where the roots of the characteristic
equation are real. Of course, this isn't always the case, but we can deal with
this using \emph{Euler's Formula},
\bee
\boxed{e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)}.
\eee
For example, if we get $r_{1,2}= 4\pm 2i$, then solutions are a linear
combination of
\bee
e^{(4+2i)t}=e^{4t}e^{i2t}=e^{4t} \(\cos(2t) + i \sin(2t)\)
\eee
and
\bee
e^{(4-2i)t}=e^{4t}e^{-i2t}=e^{4t} \(\cos(2t) - i \sin(2t)\).
\eee
An easy way to get all linear combinations is to just set
\bee
y_1(t) = e^{4t} \cos(2t), \qquad y_2(t) = e^{4t} \sin(2t).
\eee
\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Give the general solution to
\bee
\ddtwo{y}{t} + 1 =0
\eee
with initial conditions $y(0) =1, \, y'(0) =0.$\\
\noindent\emph{Solution}:
The characteristic equation is
\bee
r^2 +1 =0 \quad \implies \quad r = \pm i.
\eee
The solution is then a linear combination of
\bee
y_1(t) = e^{0t}\cos(t) = \cos(t), \qquad
y_2(t) = e^{0t}\sin(t) = \sin(t)
\eee
Setting $y(t)=\alpha \cos(t) + \beta \sin(t)$, we can input the initial
conditions to get
\bee
y(0) &=& \alpha\cos(0) + \beta\sin(0) = \alpha =1,
\\
y'(0) &=& -\alpha\sin(0) + \beta\cos(0) =\beta =0.
\eee
The solution to the IVP is then $y(t) = \cos(t)$. \qed

\section{Dealing with repeated roots}
In the above section, we were lucky, since we had two independent roots.
Two independent roots gave two independent solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$, which
we used to solve the two initial values for the problem. When we have
repeated roots, we still need to make sure that we have two independent
solutions. How do we get this? Well, just multiply one solution by $t$.
% TODO: add a footnote as to why this makes sense.

For example, suppose that we solved the characteristic equation and got
$r_1=r_2=r$. We still get one solution out of this, namely
\bee
y_1(t) =e^{rt}.
\eee
To get the second solution, just take
\bee
y_2(t) = t y_1(t) = t e^{rt}.
\eee
This works since $\ddtwo{t}{t}=0$, so the extra $t$ in $y_2$ is eventually
killed, and everything cancels out nicely.
\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Give the general solution to
\bee
\ddtwo{y}{t} - 2 \dd{y}{t}+1 =0
\eee
with initial conditions $y(0) =1, \, y'(0) =0.$\\
\noindent\emph{Solution}:
The characteristic equation for this problem is
\bee
r^2 - 2r +1 = (r-1)(r-1) =0,
\eee
which has the double root $r_1=r_2=1$. Thus, set
$y_1(t) = e^t$ and $y_2=t e^t$, so
\bee
y = \alpha e^t + \beta t e^t
\eee
Now,
\bee
y(0) = \alpha = 1.
\eee
For the second condition, calculate that
$y'(t) = \alpha e^t + \beta e^t + \beta te^t$. Thus
\bee
y'(0) = \alpha + \beta =0.
\eee
Thus, $\alpha=1$ and $\beta =-1$, so the solution is
\bee
y(t) = e^t - te^t. \qed
\eee

\chapter{Non-homogeneous Second-Order Linear Equations}

\section{Method of Undetermined Coefficients}
% Text section  4.4
The next step is to add a function to the right-hand side of equation
(\ref{sec2hom}), so that we get
\bee
a y'' + b y' + cy =f(t).
\eee
Then what we have is a \emph{non-homogeneous equation} and we say that equation
$a y'' + b y' + cy =0$ is the corresponding homogeneous equation.

In this section, we are going to restrict ourselves to a couple of choices
for $f(t)$ so that we can use the method of \emph{undetermined coefficients},
also known as \emph{we can probably guess what the answer is, so let's do
that}.

The idea behind this method is trying to find the particular solution $y_p$,
which has the property
\be \label{yp}
a y_p'' + b y_p' + cy_p =f(t),
\ee
though it need not match the initial conditions. For instance, if
$f(t)=\sin(t)$, guessing that $y_p = A \sin(t) + B \cos(t)$ would probably do
the trick. We can just substitute $y_p = A \sin(t) + B \cos(t)$ into equation
\eqref{yp} in order to find the values of $A$ and $B$ that work.

Here is a table that will guide you, young jedi:
\bee
\begin{tabular}{ l |  l }
  $f(t)$ & $y_p$  \\
  \hline
  $ke^{at}$ & $Ce^{at}$  \\
  $kt^n$ & $C_n t^n + C_{n-1}t^{n-1} + \dots + C_1 t + C_0 $  \\
  $k \cos(at)$ or $k \sin(at)$ & $K \cos(at) + M\sin(at)$ \\
  $kt^n e^{at}$ & $e^{at}\(C_n t^n + C_{n-1}t^{n-1} + \dots + C_1 t + C_0\)$ \\
  $k t^n \cos(at)$ or $k t^n \sin(at)$ &
  $\(C_nt^n + \dots +C_0 \)\cos(at) + \(D_nt^n + \dots + D_0 \)\sin(at)$ \\
  $ke^{at} \cos(bt)$ or $ke^{at} \sin(bt)$ &
  $e^{at}\(K \cos(at) + M\sin(at)\)$ \\
  $k t^n e^{at }\cos(bt)$ or $k t^n e^{at} \sin(bt)$ &
  $\(C_nt^n + \dots +C_0 \)e^{at}\cos(bt)
  + \(D_nt^n + \dots + D_0 \)e^{bt}\sin(bt)$ \\
\end{tabular}
\eee
Finally, if your guess ends up being a polynomial times a linear
combination of the solutions to the corresponding homogeneous equation (known
as $y_1$ and $y_2$ in previous lab), then multiply your
guess by $t$ until it isn't. For example, if $y_1=e^t$, $y_2=e^{2t}$, and
$f(t)=t^2e^t$, then you would choose $y_p = t\(C_2 t^2 + C_1 t + C_0 \)e^t$.
If $y_1=e^t$, $y_2=t e^t$, and $f(t)=t^2e^t$, then you would choose
$y_p = t^2 \(C_2 t^2 + C_1 t + C_0 \)e^t$.

Once you have determined $y_p$, combine it with the homogeneous solutions
to give the general solution
\be
\boxed{y(t) = \alpha y_1(t) + \beta y_2(t) + y_p(t) }
\ee
to match the initial conditions.
\\

\noindent \emph{Example}:
Solve the IVP
\be \label{undetceg}
y'' -3y' +2 y = t
\ee
with $y(0) = 3/4$ and $y'(0) = 3/2$.\\
\noindent \emph{Solution}:
This has characteristic equation
\bee
r^2 -3r +2 = (r-1)(r-2) \quad \implies \quad r_1=1, \, r_2=2,
\eee
so the homogeneous solutions are $y_1(t) = e^t, \, y_2=e^{2t}$. Since
$f(t)=t$ is not a linear combination of $y_1$ and $y_2$, we can just choose
$y_p = C_1 t + C_0$. Putting this into equation \eqref{undetceg}, we get
\bee
\ddtwo{(C_1 t + C_0)}{t} -3\dd{(C_1 t + C_0)}{t} + 2 \(C_1 t + C_0\) =t
\quad \implies \quad
-3 C_1 + 2C_1 t + 2C_0 = t,
\eee
so $C_1=1/2$ and $C_0=3/4$. Thus, $y_p = \frac{t}{2} +\frac{3}{4}$, and the
general solution is
\bee
y = \alpha e^t + \beta e^{2t} + \frac{t}{2} +\frac{3}{4}.
\eee
Now, we satisfy the initial conditions:
\bee
y(0) = \alpha + \beta +\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\quad \implies \quad \alpha+\beta=0,
\eee
and
\bee
y'(0) = \alpha + 2\beta + \half = \frac{3}{2}
\quad \implies \quad \alpha+2 \beta=1
\eee
so $\alpha=-1$ and $\beta =1$. The solution is therefore
\bee
y(t) = -e^t +e^{2t}  + \frac{t}{2} +\frac{3}{4}.
\eee
Let's check this solution. We have
\bee
y(t) &=& -e^t +e^{2t}  + \frac{t}{2} +\frac{3}{4}
\\
y'(t) &=& -e^t +2e^{2t}  + \frac{1}{2}
\\
y''(t) &=& -e^t +4 e^{2t}.
\eee
Putting these into equation \eqref{undetceg} yields
\bee
&&y'' - 3 y' + 2 y
\\
&&= \(-e^t + 4 e^{2t}\)
-3 \(-e^t +2e^{2t}  + \frac{1}{2} \)
+2 \(-e^t +e^{2t}  + \frac{t}{2} + \frac{3}{4} \) = t,
\eee
as required. \qed

\section{Superposition Principle}
Suppose that we know the solution $y_{1,p}$ to
\be
  ay'' + by' + cy = f(t)
\ee
and the solution $y_{2,p}$ to
\be
  ay'' + by' + cy = g(t).
\ee
We can use these to determine the solution to the more difficult problem
\be \label{super}
  ay'' + by' +cy = A f(t) + B g(t)
\ee
by using the fact that the differential operator
\be
L = a \ddtwo{}{t}  + b \dd{}{t} + c
\ee
is linear. That is, for constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$
\be
  L\(\alpha y_{1,p} + \beta y_{2,p} \)
  &=&
  a \(\alpha y_{1,p} + \beta y_{2,p} \)'' + b \(\alpha y_{1,p}+\beta y_{2,p}\)'
  + c\(\alpha y_{1,p} + \beta y_{2,p} \)
  \\
  &=& \alpha \(a y_{1,p}'' + b y_{1,p}' + c  y_{1,p}\)
  + \beta \(a y_{2,p}'' + b y_{2,p}' + c  y_{2,p}\)
  \\
  &=&
  \alpha L\( y_{1,p}\)  + \beta L\(y_{2,p} \),
\ee
just like ``linearity'' is defined in linear algebra. Then since
$L\(y_{1,p}\)= f(t)$ and $L\(y_{2,p}\) = g(t)$,
\be
  L\(A y_{1,p} + B y_{2,p} \) = A f(t) + B g(t),
\ee
which gives us the particular solution for equation \eqref{super} without
having to do a lot of extra work.
\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Find the general solution to
\be
  y'' -3 y' -4y = t + 10 e^{-t}.
\ee
\noindent\emph{Solution}:
The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is
$0 = r^2 -3r -4 = (r+1)(r-4)$ which gives $r_1=-1$ and $r_2=4$. The solution
space is then spanned by $\{y_1=e^{-t},y_2=e^{4t}\}$.
We can use the superposition principle to break
this problem up into two smaller problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \be \label{supereg1}
    y'' -3 y' -4y = t
  \ee
  Notice that $t$ is not a multiple of $y_1$ or $y_2$, so, looking at the
  table, we use $y_{1,p}=at + b$. Plugging this into equation
  \eqref{supereg1}, we get
  \be
  - 3\(a\) -4\(at + b\) = t
  \ee
  Grouping the terms that have a factor of $t$, we get $-4a t =t$ $\implies$
  $a =-1/4$.
  Similarly, the constant terms give us $ -3a -4b =0$,
  which, with $a=-1/4$, gives $b=3/16$. Thus
  \be
  y_{1,p}= \frac{-t}{4} + \frac{3}{16}.
  \ee


\item
  \be \label{supereg2}
    y'' -3 y' -4y = e^{-t}
  \ee
  The situation here is slightly different, since $e^{-t}$ is both part
  of the homogeneous solution, and on the right-hand side. Thus, we need
  to choose $y_{2,p} = ct e^{-t}$. Plugging this into equation
  \eqref{supereg2}, we get
  \be
  \(ct  -2c \)e^{-t} -3 \(-ct +c \)e^{-t} -4 ct  e^{-t} =e^{-t}.
  \ee
  Dividing by $e^{-t}$ and gathering powers of $t$, we get the following
  system:
  \be
  ct +3ct -4ct =0 \quad \implies \quad 0 =0 \\
  -2c -3c = 1 \quad \implies \quad c = -\frac{1}{5}
  \ee
  Notice that the first equation didn't tell us anything, but the second
  equation gave us everything that we needed to solve the system. That is
  \be
  y_{2,p} = -\frac{te^{-t}}{5}.
  \ee
\end{enumerate}
We combine these two solutions to give us the particular solution for the
problem: we want $L(y_p) = t+10e^{-t}$. We found that $y_{1,p}$ gives us $t$,
and $y_{2,p}$ gives us $e^{-t}$, so we choose
\be
y_p = y_{1,p} + 10 y_{2,p} = \frac{-t}{4} + \frac{3}{16} -2 t e^{-t}.
\ee
The general solution is then
\be
y = \alpha y_1 + \beta y_2 + y_p
= \alpha e^{-t} + \beta e^{4t} -2 t e^{-t} -\frac{t}{4} + \frac{3}{16}. \qed
\ee

\chapter{Non-Homogeneous Second-Order Linear Equations:
  \\Variation of Parameters}
%TODO: maybe add a footnote giving the theory why this works?
The method of undetermined coefficients is pretty easy, but it only works
when we have certain functions on the right-hand side. The method of
variation of parameters gives us a more general way to determine $y_p$.
The technique is actually an application of Cramer's rule from linear algebra,
and can be generalized to linear differential equations of any order.

Given a differential equation
\be
y'' + by' +cy = f(t)
\ee
with homogeneous solutions $\{y_1(t), y_2(t)\}$, we are going to look for
a particular solution of the form $y_p=u_1(t) y_1(t) + u_2(t) y_2(t)$. This
means that $y_p' = \(u_1' y_1 + u_2' y_2\) + \(u_1 y_1' + u_2 y_2'\)$, which
we can simplify by setting\footnote{If you work out the details, it's easy
to see that equation~\eqref{voprandom} makes the system much easier to solve
because it reduces the order of the system for $u_1$ and $u_2$. The addition
of equation~\ref{voprandom} gives us two equations to solve for two unknowns.
The authors still find this trick a little unmotivated, but rest assured that
it does work.}
\be
\label{voprandom}
u_1'y_1 +u_2'y_2 =0.
\ee
Substituting this into the original differential equation produces the linear
system
\be
u_1'y_1 +u_2'y_2 &=&0
\\ \nonumber
u_1'y_1' +u_2'y_2' &=&f.
\ee
Using Cramer's rule to solve the linear system, the solution is
\be
%y_p
%&=& y_1 \int
%\(
%\left .
%{\left| \begin{array}{cc}0 & y_2 \\f & y_2' \end{array} \right|}

%y_p&=& y_1 \int \frac{-f y_2}{w } \, dt + y_2 \int \frac{f y_1}{w} \, dt
\boxed{

}
\ee
where
\be
w=
\left| \begin{array}{cc}
y_1 & y_2  \\
y_1' & y_2' \end{array} \right|
\ee
is known as the Wronskian. The general solution is, as always,
\be
y = \alpha y_1 + \beta y_2 + y_p.
\ee
\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Give the general solution to
\be \label{varpareg}
y'' -2 y' + 2y = 2 e^t
\ee
using variation of parameters.\\
\noindent\emph{Solution}: The characteristic equation is
\be
r^2 -2r +2 =0
\ee
which has roots $r=1\pm i$. Thus, $y_1=e^t\cos t$, and $y_2=e^t \sin t$.
The Wronskian is
\be
w=
\left| \begin{array}{cc}
y_1 & y_2  \\
y_1' & y_2' \end{array} \right|
=e^{2t} \[\cos t \(\cos t + \sin t\) - \sin t \(\cos t - \sin t \) \]
=e^{2t}.
\ee
The particular solution is
\be
y_p &=& e^t \cos t \int \frac{ -2 e^t e^t \sin t}{e^{2t}} \,dt \,
+ e^t \sin t \int \frac{ 2 e^t e^t \cos t}{e^{2t}} \,dt \,
\\\nonumber
&=& 2e^t \(\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t\) = 2e^t.
\ee
\\
\noindent\emph{Check}: When we put $y_p$ into equation \eqref{varpareg}, we
get
\be
2e^t  -4 e^t + 4 e^t = 2 e^t,
\ee
so we got the correct $y_p$. \qed

\chapter{Laplace Transforms}

Transformations are a very interesting part of mathematics because they give us
another perspective from which to look at a problem. If we're lucky with
our choice of transformation, we can solve the problem.

The Laplace transform of a function $f(t)$, which we denote by either
$\Laplace(f(t))$ or $F(s)$, is defined as
\be
\boxed{\Laplace(f(t)) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) \, dt}.
\ee
This is itself a function, though we have changed the independent variable
from $t$ to $s$. So long as $f$ is sufficiently smooth and doesn't grow too
fast as $t$ goes to infinity, we can always find its Laplace transform.\\

\noindent\emph{Example}: Find the Laplace transform of
\be
f(t) = t
\ee
\noindent\emph{Solution}: The Laplace transform of $t$ is given by
\be
F(s) = \int_0^\infty t e^{-st} \, dt
\ee
Using integration by parts with $u=t$ and $dv=e^{-st}$,
\be
F(s) =\left. t \frac{e^{-st}}{-s} \right|_0^\infty
- \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-st}}{-s}\, dt
= \frac{1}{s^2},
\ee
that is, $\mathcal{L}(t)= 1/s^2$.\\

Well, that was an excellent example, and we all had a lot of fun. The question
remains, however, ``why is this useful?'' Consider the Laplace transform of
the first derivative of $y(t)$:
\be
\Laplace(y') = \int_0^\infty y'(t) e^{-st} \, dt
= \left. y(t) e^{-st} \right|_0^\infty - \int_0^\infty y \(-s e^{-st}\) \, dt,
\ee
so
\be
\boxed{\Laplace(y')= s \mathcal{L}(y) - y(0)}.
\ee
That is, the Laplace transform changes derivatives into polynomials in $s$,
which can be much easier to deal with!
The Laplace transform of the $n$th derivative of $y$ is
\be
\boxed{
\Laplace(y^{(n)}) = s^n \mathcal{L}(y) -s^{n-1} y(0) -\dots -y^{(n-1)}(0)
},
\ee
which we will apply to higher-order differential equations.

%FIXME: should these just be moved to the table?
%The Laplace transform has some important properties, of which we will make
%use. These are:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item the Laplace transform is linear,
%\item $\mathcal{L}(e^{at} f(t)) = F(s-a)$,
%\item $\mathcal{L}(t^n f(t)) = (-1)^n \frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s)$.
%\end{enumerate}

\noindent\emph{Example}: Compute the Laplace transform of the function
\bee
f(t) = e^{2t} + e^{3t}.
\eee
~\\
\emph{Solution 1}:  By the definition of the Laplace transform,
\bee
\Laplace \{f\}(s)&=& \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\
&=& \int_0^\infty \(e^{2t} + e^{3t}\) e^{-st} dt
\\
&=& \int_0^\infty e^{2t} e^{-st} dt + \int_0^\infty e^{3t} e^{-st} dt
\\
&=& \left.\frac{e^{(2-s)t}}{2-s}\right|_0^\infty
+  \left.\frac{e^{(3-s)t}}{3-s}\right|_0^\infty
\\
&=& \frac{1}{s-2} + \frac{1}{s-3}. \qed
\eee
Alternatively, we can solve this using the table of Laplace transforms:
~\\
\emph{Solution 2}:  The Laplace transform is linear, so
\bee
\Laplace\{e^{2t} + e^{3t}\}
&=& \Laplace\{e^{2t}\} + \Laplace\{e^{3t}\}
= \frac{1}{s-2} + \frac{1}{s-3}. \qed
\eee
Of course, you should know how to use both techniques.

\chapter{Solving DEs with Laplace Transforms}

Consider a first-order IVP of the form
\bee
y' + by = f(t), \qquad y(0)=y_0.
\eee
Taking the Laplace transform of the DE and applying the properties of Laplace
transforms yields
\bee
s\Laplace (y) - y(0) + b \Laplace(y) = \Laplace(f).
\eee
Rearranging for $\Laplace(y)$, we get
\bee
\Laplace(y) =\frac{\Laplace(f) + y_0}{s+b}.
\eee
We need to invert the Laplace transform in order to determine $y$.
Since the inverse Laplace transform is kind of complicated, the easiest
way to deal with this is to use the table of Laplace transforms found in
section \ref{tableolap}.

It is often necessary to use the technique of partial fractions to disentangle
the Laplace transform of the solution so we can take the inverse transform.
Here's an example of how it works in an initial value problem:\\
\noindent\emph{Example}:
Solve the following differential equation using Laplace transforms
\begin{equation*}
  y'' + 4y = 4 t^2 - 4t +10, \qquad y(0) = 0, \qquad y'(0)=3
\end{equation*}
\noindent\emph{Solution}:
Since
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Laplace(y'') &=& s^{2} \Laplace(y)-sy(0)-y'(0)\\
          &=& s^{2} \Laplace(y)-3,
\end{eqnarray*}
the Laplace transform of the left hand side is
\begin{equation*}
 s^{2} \Laplace(y)-3 + 4 \Laplace(y)
\end{equation*}
which is equal to the Laplace transform of the right hand side,
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{8}{s^3} - \frac{4}{s^2} + \frac{10}{s}.
\end{equation*}
Rearranging for $\Laplace(y)$ yields
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \Laplace(y) = \frac{8 - 4s +10 s^2 + 3s^3}{s^{3}(s^{2}+4)}
\end{eqnarray*}
and we need to use partial fractions to deal with this.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{8 - 4s +10 s^2 + 3s^3}{s^{3}(s^{2}+4)}
&=& \frac{As^2 + Bs + C}{s^3} + \frac{Ds +E}{s^2 + 4} \\
\implies
8 -4s +10s^2 +3s^3 &=& (A+D)s^4 + (B+E)s^3 +(C+4A)s^2 + 4Bs +4C
\end{eqnarray*}
We can match the coefficients of each power of $s$ to get
\begin{eqnarray*}
4C=8 &\implies& C=2\\
4B=-4 &\implies& B=-1\\
2 + 4A = 10 &\implies& A=2\\
-1+E=3 &\implies& E=4\\
A+D=0 &\implies& D=-2.
\end{eqnarray*}
So we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Laplace(y) = \frac{2s^2 - s + 2}{s^3} + \frac{-2s +4}{s^2 + 4}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Now use the table of Laplace transforms to get
\begin{eqnarray*}
y(t) = t^2 -t +2 +2 \sin{2t} - 2 \cos{2t}. \qed
\end{eqnarray*}



\section{Laplace Transforms of Periodic Functions}

Periodic functions behave particularly nicely under Laplace transforms. Suppose
the function $f(t)$ is periodic with period $T$. That is, for all $t$,
\bee
f(t+T)=f(t).
\eee
The Laplace transform of $f$ is
\bee
\Laplace\{f\} &=& \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt
\\
&=&\int_0^T f(t) e^{-st} dt + \int_T^{2T} f(t) e^{-st} dt + \dots +
\int_{nT}^{(n+1)T} f(t) e^{-st} dt + \dots
\eee
Then we perform the change of variables $\tau = t-nT$ to see that this is just
\bee
&=& \int_0^T f(\t) e^{-s\t} d\t + e^{-sT}\int_0^{T} f(\t) e^{-s\t} d\t + \dots +
e^{-nsT}\int_0^T f(\t) e^{-s\t} d\t + \dots
\\
&=& \(1+e^{-sT} + e^{-2sT} + \dots + e^{-nsT} +\dots\)\int_0^T f(\t) e^{-s\t}d\t.
\eee
Now, the first factor is just the geometric series
$\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n = 1/(1-r)$ with $r=e^{-sT}$, so
\be\label{lapper}
\boxed{\Laplace\{f\} =\frac{\int_0^Tf(t) e^{-st}dt}{1-e^{-sT}}}.
\ee

\workedexample{Find the Laplace transform of a saw wave with period $T=1$,

        f(t-N) & \mbox{if $t \in (N,N+1)$ for $N\in \N$}.\end{array} \right.
\eee
}{
From equation \eqref{lapper}, we have
\bee
\Laplace\{f\}
= \frac{\int_0^1 t e^{-st}dt}{1-e^{-sT}}
= \frac{\[t \frac{e^{-st}}{-s}\]_0^1 -\int_0^1 \frac{e^{-st}}{-s} dt}{1-e^{-s}}

\section{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Find $\Laplace^{-1}F(s)$ if
  \bee
  F(s) = \frac{5s^2+s-3}{(s+3)(s^2-2s-3)}
  \eee
  \hidesolution{
    We first factor the denominator:
    \bee
    (s+3)(s^2-2s-3) = (s+3)(s-3)(s+1).
    \eee
    Then using partial fractions we write down the equation
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      F(s) &=& \frac{5s^2+s-3}{(s+3)(s-3)(s+1)} \\
      &=& \frac{A}{s+3} + \frac{B}{s-3} + \frac{C}{s+1} \\
      &=& \frac{A(s-3)(s+1)+B(s+3)(s+1)+C(s+3)(s-3)}{(s+3)(s-3)(s+1)},
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are the coefficients we need to find.  In order to
    do this, we equate the two numerators to arrive at
    $$ 5s^2+s-3 = A(s-3)(s+1)+B(s+3)(s+1)+C(s+3)(s-3). $$
    Since the above equation must hold for every real $s$, in particular it is
    satisfied for $s=-3$, $s=3$ and $s=-1$.  Thus,
    \bee
    \begin{array}{lcccl}
      \textnormal{when } s=-3 & \Longrightarrow &
      45-3-3=A(-6)(-2) & \Longrightarrow &

      C=-\frac{\phantom{-}1}{8} \\

    \frac{15}{8}\frac{1}{s-3}-
    \frac{1}{8}\frac{1}{s+1}

\chapter{Laplace Transforms: Convolutions, Impulses and Delta functions}

\section{Convolutions}
The Laplace transform is linear, so it deals with linear DEs very well. But not
all DEs are linear. In fact, the most aren't.

The Laplace transform is a good tool when the nonlinear term is a convolution.
The convolution of two functions $f$ and $g$ is written $f*g$ and is defined as
\be
\boxed{f*g=\int_0^t f(t-\tau) g(\tau) \,d\tau}.
\ee
It has a particularly nice Laplace transform. If we write $\Laplace(f)=F$ and
$\Laplace(g)=G$, then
\be
\boxed{\Laplace(f*g)=F(s)G(s)}.
\ee
That is, the Laplace transform of a convolution is the product of their Laplace
transforms.

\workedexample{
Solve
\bee
y'' = g(t), \qquad y(0) = c_0, \qquad y'(0)=c_1

 for $y$ using Laplace transforms.
}\\
{
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we have
\bee
s^2Y - sc_0 - c_1 = G(s).
\eee
Solving for $Y$ yields
\bee
Y = \frac{G + sc_0 + c_1}{s^2}= \frac{G}{s^2} + \frac{c_0}{s} + \frac{c_1}{s^2}.
\eee
}
The solution is then the inverse Laplace transform, i.e.\
\bee
y = \Laplace^{-1}\(G(s)\frac{1}{s^2} + c_0 + c_1 t\)
= g(t)*t + c_0 + c_1 t. \qed
\eee

This technique can be extended to the full harmonic oscillator,
\bee
y'' + by' + cy = g
\eee
which then has solution
\be
\boxed{
y = \Laplace^{-1}\(\frac{G + sc_0 + c_1 +b c_0}{s^2+bs+c} \)
}.
\ee


\section{Laplace Transforms of Discontinuous Functions}

The Laplace transform, like the method of variation of parameters, allows us
to solve differential equations by integrating. This can be tremendously useful,
since we can deal with differential equations with functions that are not
smooth; they need only be integrable.

The step function, also known as the Heaviside function, is defined as
\be
\boxed{
u_c(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
         0 & \mbox{if $t < c$};\\
        1 & \mbox{if $t > c$}.\end{array} \right.
}
\ee
and is useful for describing processes that start at a certain time.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{201/step}
    \caption{Graph of the step function $u_c(t)$.}
    \label{step}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The Laplace transform of the step function is straightforward to calculate. If
we take $c>0$, then
\bee
\Laplace{}\(u_c(t)\) &=& \int_0^\infty u_c(t) e^{-st} dt
\\\nonumber
&=& \int_c^\infty e^{-st} dt
\\\nonumber
&=&\frac{e^{-cs}}{s}.
\eee

The step function often shows up multiplied by other functions, as in the
following example.\\
\workedexample{Solve the differential equation
\bee
y'=t u_c(t), \qquad y(0)=0
\eee
using Laplace transforms.\\
}
{
Take the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation, yielding
\bee
sY &=& \Laplace{}\(t u_c(t)\) = \int_0^\infty t u_c(t) e^{-st} dt
= \int_c^\infty t e^{-st} dt
\\\nonumber
&=& \[t \frac{e^{-st}}{-s}\]_c^\infty - \int_c^\infty \frac{e^{-st}}{-s}dt
= \frac{-ce^{-sc}}{s} + \frac{e^{-sc}}{s^2}
\eee
Thus,
\bee
Y = \frac{ce^{-sc}}{s} +\frac{e^{-sc}}{s^3}.
\eee
From the table of  Laplace transforms, we know that
$\Laplace{}\(f(t-c)u_c(t)\)=e^{-cs}F(s)$, so
\bee
y = -c(t-c)u_c(t) + \frac{1}{2} (t-c)^2 u_c(t). \qed %FIXME: check
\eee
}



\section{The Impulse Function}
While the step function describes functions which start suddenly (like turning
on a switch), the delta function, $\d(t)$, is slightly more complicated. It
describes processes that happen in an instant, like the impact from a hammer.
It is (loosely) defined as having the following properties:
\be
\boxed{
\delta(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
         \infty & \mbox{if $t = 0$};\\
        0 & \mbox{if $t \neq 0$}.\end{array} \right.
}
\ee
and, for any function $f(t)$,
\be \label{deltaprop}
\boxed{\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) \delta(t)\, dt = f(0)}.
\ee
Approximations to the delta function are shown in figure~\ref{deltafig}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{201/delta}
    \caption{Approximations to $\d(x)$.}
    \label{deltafig}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


\noindent\emph{Example}: Solve the following differential equation using
Laplace transforms.
\bee
2y'' + y' + 2y = \delta(t-5), \qquad y'(0)=y(0)=0
\eee
\emph{Solution}: Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we have
\be \label{exeq1}
\(2s^2 + s +2\) Y = e^{-5s}.
\ee
To see that the Laplace transform of $\delta(t-5)$ is $e^{-5s}$, consider the
definition of the Laplace transform:
\be
\mathcal{L}(\delta(t-5)) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \delta(t-5)\, dt.
\ee
If we let $\tau = t-5$, then this is the same as
\bee
\int_{-5}^{\infty} e^{-s(\tau+5)} \delta(\tau)\, d\tau .
\eee
Then we apply equation (\ref{deltaprop}) to see that this is just $e^{-5s}$.

Going back to equation (\ref{exeq1}), solving for $Y$ and completing the
square yields
\bee
Y = \frac{e^{-5s}}{2} \( \frac{1}{\(s+\frac{1}{4}\)^2 + \frac{15}{16}} \).
\eee
Finding the inverse transform is the hardest part of this process, but we can
break it up into smaller steps. We can just pull the $1/2$ out
because the Laplace transform is linear and then if we rearrange this, we get
\bee
Y = \frac{2}{\sqrt{15}}  \, e^{-5s}
\frac{\sqrt{\frac{15}{16}}}{\(s+\frac{1}{4}\)^2 + \frac{15}{16}}
= \frac{2}{\sqrt{15}}  \, e^{-5s} \,
\Laplace\[e^\frac{-t}{4}\sin\(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}t \) \]
\eee
Now we have an exponential term, $e^{-5s}$, times a term that is the Laplace
transform of $e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t)$ with $\alpha=1/4$ and
$\beta=\sqrt{{15}/{16}}$. So we will use the Laplace
transform table to see that $Y$ is the Laplace transform of
\bee
y=\frac{2}{\sqrt{15}}u_5(t) e^\frac{-(t-5)}{4}\sin\(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}(t-5)\).
\qed
\eee

\section{Problems}

    \bee

    y(t) + t \ast y(t) = 1.

\chapter{Solving Systems of Differential Equations}

Up to now, we could have solved every problem with the method of variation
of parameters. You've probably noticed that some questions are easier to
solve with certain techniques than with others, of course, but VoP will handle
any nonhomogeneous part, so long as you can calculate the integral. Here's
something that it won't handle:
\\

\noindent\emph{Example}:
Solve the system of initial value problems for both $x$ and $y$:
\bee
x' &=& -y \qquad x(0)=0 \\
y' &=& \phantom{-}x \qquad y(0)=1 \\
\eee
Well, you can actually solve this by doing tricky things like taking the
derivative of one of the equations, but let's use Laplace transforms:
\\

\noindent\emph{Solution}: The Laplace transform of the original system is
\bee
sX &=& -Y \\
sY-1 &=&\phantom{-}X.
\eee
Solving for $Y$ yields
\be
\label{syseg1}
sY -1 = \frac{-Y}{s} \quad \implies \quad Y = \frac{s}{s^2+1}.
\ee
Taking the inverse Laplace transform of equation (\ref{syseg1}) gives us
\bee
y(t) = \cos t.
\eee
We can solve for $X$ in a similar way, or just notice that $x=y'$, i.e.\
\bee
x(t) = -\sin t
\eee

Systems of differential equations model situations where there are two or
more quantities being evolved, such as heat and reaction rate, or predator and
prey populations. While they are obviously of great use, they can get
quite complicated as the number of variables increases (and are greatly
simplified by writing them in terms of matrices).\\


\noindent\emph{Example}: Solve the following system of differential equations:
\bee
x' - 3x + 2y = \sin t\\
4x -y' - y = \cos t
\eee
with initial conditions $x(0)=y(0)=0$.
\\

\noindent\emph{Solution}:\\
We take the Laplace transform of each equation and put in the initial
conditions, which yields
\bee
sX - 3X +2Y = \frac{1}{s^2+1}\\
4X -sY -Y = \frac{s}{s^2+1}.
\eee
We can solve the second equation for X:
\bee
X = \frac{1}{4}\(\frac{s}{s^2+1} + (s+1)Y\)
\eee
Put this into the first equation, so
\bee
\(s-3\)\(\frac{1}{4} \frac{s}{s^2+1} + \frac{s+1}{4}Y\) +2Y
= \frac{1}{s^2+1}
\eee
which gives
\be
\label{sysY}
Y &=& -\frac{(s-4)(s+1)}{(s^2+1)(s^2-2s+5)} \\ \nonumber
&=& \frac{11s +7}{10(s^2+1)} + \frac{-11s + 5}{10(s^2-2s+5)}  \\ \nonumber
&=& \frac{11s}{10(s^2+1)} + \frac{7}{10(s^2+1)} +
\frac{-11}{10}\frac{s-1}{(s-1)^2 + 2^2}
-  \frac{3}{10}\frac2{(s-1)^2 + 2^2}
\ee
by partial fractions and completing the square in the last two terms. We are
now in a position to use an inverse Laplace transform to get $y(t)$:
\bee
y(t) = \frac{7}{10} \sin t + \frac{11}{10} \cos t
- \frac{11}{10}e^{t}\cos 2t - \frac{3}{10}e^{t}\sin 2t
\eee
It now remains to solve for $x(t)$. We use the solution for $X$
and the Laplace transform of $y$. This is to say
\be
\label{sysX}
X &=& \frac{1}{4}\(\frac{s}{s^2+1} + (s+1)Y\)\\ \nonumber
 &=& \frac{-1 + 7s}{10(s^2+1)} + \frac{-7s + 15}{10(s^2-2s+5)} \\ \nonumber
 &=& \frac{7s}{10(s^2+1)} + \frac{-1}{10(s^2+1)} + \frac{-7}{10}
\frac{s-1} {(s-1)^2 + 2^2} +  \frac{2}{5}\frac{2}{(s-1)^2 + 2^2}
\ee
So we can now use an inverse Laplace transform to get $x(t)$.
\bee
x(t) = \frac{-1}{10} \sin t + \frac{7}{10} \cos t - \frac{7}{10}e^{t}\cos 2t
+ \frac{2}{5}e^{t}\sin 2t
\eee

Alternatively, we could have solved this as a linear system, since
\bee
\[ \begin{array}{ll}
    (s-3) & 2\\
    4 & -(s+1)
  \end{array} \]
\( \begin{array}{l}
    X\\
    Y
  \end{array} \)
=
\( \begin{array}{l}
    \frac{1}{s^2+1}\\
    \frac{s}{s^2+1}
  \end{array} \)
\eee
which is easily solved for $X$ and $Y$ to give
\bee
\( \begin{array}{l}
    X\\
    Y
  \end{array} \)
=
\frac{1}{s^2+1} \cdot \frac{1}{s^2-2s+5}
\( \begin{array}{l}
    3s+1\\
    s^2 -3s -4
  \end{array} \),
\eee
which brings us to equations (\ref{sysY}) and (\ref{sysX}) with a lot less
work. \qed

\chapter{Series Solutions to DEs}

A smooth function $f(t)$ can be approximated near a point $t=a$ by looking
at its derivatives. In fact, if $f$ is smooth enough, its value at any
given $t$ can be entirely determined by its behaviour at $t=a$.

The most basic approximation that we can make is that the function stays
constant. For example, a good guess for the temperature in ten minutes would
be what the temperature is now. That is, we approximate $f$ as
\bee
f(t) \approx f_0(t) = f(a).
\eee
Now, it may be that the sun is shining, so we expect it to heat up. Then our
next approximation is to account for this using $f'(a)$, i.e.\
\bee
f(t) \approx f_1(t) = f(a) + f'(a) (t-a).
\eee
As the sun sets, the rate of heating changes, so we need to add a term with
$f''(a)$, which gives us
\bee
f(t) \approx f_2(t) = f(a) + f'(a) (t-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2}\(t-a\)^2,
\eee
and so on. This is called a \emph{Taylor Polynomial Approximation} (or simply a
Taylor polynomial). It's easy to deal with both analytically and numerically,
and it can be used to get at least a basic understanding of just about any IVP.

The $n$th degree Taylor polynomial is
\be
\boxed{f_n(t) = f(a) + f'(a)(t-a) + \dots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (t-a)^n
= \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!}(t-a)^i},
\ee
and it exists for any function $f$ whose first $n$ derivatives are smooth for
$t\in [a,t]$.
Let $R_n(t) = f(t) -f_n(t)$ denote the error associated with the $n$th Taylor
polynomial. Then, Taylor's theorem states that there exists a number
$\xi \in [a,t]$ where
\be
\boxed{R_n(t) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(t-a)^{n+1}}.
\ee
So long as $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} R_n(t) =0$, $f_n$ will be a better and
better approximation as $n$ increases.


The Taylor series of $f$ is the limit of $f_n$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, which is
\be
\boxed{\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!}(t-a)^i}.
\ee
The Taylor series for $f$ exists as long as every derivative of $f$ is
continuous (i.e.\ $f$ is \emph{analytic}), and is equal to $f$ if their
difference is zero (i.e.\ $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} R_n(t) =0$). Since these
things are equal, we can use this to solve equations. Of course, we need to
make sure that these series converge in order for our solution to make sense.
What's more, if $f$ is analytic, then the derivative of the sum is the sum
of the derivatives, which can greatly simplify things.\\

\workedexample{
  Find the Taylor series for $f=e^x$ about $x=0$ and its interval of
  convergence.
}{
  First, we need to find the derivatives of $e^x$. This is easy, since
  \bee
  f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d^n}{dx^n}e^x = e^x.
  \eee
  Thus, $f^{(n)}(0)=e^0=1$, so the Taylor series is given by
  \bee
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} x^n.
  \eee
  For what values of $x$ will this series converge? To determine this, we'll
  have to use a convergence test. Letting $A=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$
  $B=\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$ be two series, our test are:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The comparison test: if
    $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \abs{a_n/b_n} \in (0,\infty)$, then $A$
    converges if and only if $B$ converges.
  \item The ratio test: if
    $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\abs{\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}}=c < 1$, then $A$
    converges.
  \item The root test: if $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\abs{a_n}^{1/n}=c < 1$,
    then $A$ converges.
  \item The integral test: if there is a function $f$ with $f(n)=a_n$, then
    $A$ converges if and only if $\int_0^\infty f(t) dt$ is finite.
  \item The alternating series test: if $a_n = (-1)^n c_n$, then $A$
    converges so long as $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}c_n=0$ and each $c_n$ is
    smaller than $c_{n-1}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Let's try the ratio test. That is, fix $x$ and look at
  \bee
  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}
  = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x^{n+1}/(n+1)!}{x^n/n!}
  =\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x}{n+1} =0 < 1.
  \eee
  That is, for any $x\in \mathbb{R}$, $n+1$ will eventually be greater than
  $x$.  Thus, the limit is zero, and the series converges for all
  $x \in (-\infty,\infty) =\mathbb{R}$. \qed
}

In the above example, the series converged everywhere. This isn't always
the case: often, a series solution to a differential equation is only
valid in some neighbourhood of the initial conditions, and the series
becomes divergent when $\abs{t-a} > r$, and we call $r$ the radius of
convergence.\\

\workedexample{
  Find the radius of convergence for the Taylor series for $f=\arctan(x)$
  about $x=0$.\\
}
{
  The Taylor series for $\arctan(z)$ is
  \bee
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n z^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
  \eee
  Using the ratio test again, we look at
  \bee
  \abs{\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}} = \frac{z^{2(n+1)+1}/(2(n+1)+1)}{z^{2n+1}/(2n+1)}
  = \frac{z^2}{(2n+3)/(2n+1)}\rightarrow z^2
  \eee
  Clearly, this limit is only less than one if $\abs{z}<1$. We still need to
  check the case when $\abs{z}=1$. This is pretty easy to do, since if $z=1$,
  the series is just
  \bee
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1},
  \eee
  which converges by the alternating series test. Similarly, the series
  converges if $z=-1$. Thus, the interval of convergence is $\[-1,1\]$.
  \qed
}

Now that we can calculate Taylor series and know when they are valid, we
can use them to calculate solutions to differential equations. To simplify
matters, we will restrict ourselves to initial value problems
which begin at $t=0$, so that $a=0$ in all the above formulae. Now, we can
express the solution $y(t)$ as a Taylor series,
\bee
y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^n .
\eee
We assume that this solution is analytic, so we can take the derivative of the
series term-by-term. That is,
\bee
\dd{y}{t} = \dd{}{t}\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^n
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \dd{(a_n t^n)}{t} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n n t^{n-1}
= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n t^{n-1}
\eee
(the last equality is because when $n=0$ we have that $a_n n t^{n-1}=0$, so we
can ignore the term with $n=0$). Since we know that $a_0=y(0)$, and $y(0)$ is
given by the initial conditions, we can solve for the rest of the $a_n$
recursively.\\

{

  and $a_3 = \frac{1}{3}$. The solution is then
  \bee
  y(t) = 1 +\frac{t^2}{2} +\frac{t^3}{3}.

}
It was easy to isolate all of the $a_n$'s in the previous example, since $y'$
appeared alone in the IVP. It's usually necessary to solve for $a_n$
recursively.\\

  In order for this to hold for all $t$ in a neighbourhood of $t=0$, it must
  be that
  \be
  \label{seriesrec}
  a_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) +a_n =0.
  \ee
  From the initial conditions, we have $a_0=1$ and $a_1=0$. We can solve
  for $a_2$ by setting $n=0$ in equation \eqref{seriesrec}, which yields
  \bee
  a_2 \times 2 \times 1 = -1, \implies a_2=-\half.
  \eee
  If we have $n$ even, then $n=2p$, and
  \bee
  a_{2p} = -\frac{a_{2p-2}}{2p(2p-1)} = \frac{a_{2p-4}}{2p(2p-1)(2p-3)(2p-4)}
  = \dots
  = \frac{(-1)^p a_0}{(2p)!} =\frac{(-1)^p}{(2p)!}
  \eee
  It's easy to see that $a_3=0$, and, in fact, $a_n=0$ if $n$ is odd. Since
  we now know the values for all the $a_n$, we can write the solution:
  \bee
  y(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty t^n
  \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{(-1)^{n/2}}{n!} & \mbox{if $n$ is even};\\
    0 & \mbox{if $n$ is odd}.
  \end{array} \right.
  = \sum_{p=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^p t^{2p}}{(2p)!}. \qed
 \eee
 You may recall from previous classes that this is just the Taylor series
 for $\cos t$.

  \hidesolution{
    For this series $a_n = \frac{3^n}{n}$ and $x_0 = 2$, so

    = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n}
    \eee
    which is the alternating harmonic series which converges (recall that an
    alternating series converges $\iff$ the terms go to 0),
    and at $x = \frac{7}{3}$ we have

\chapter{Series Solutions to DEs at Regular Singular Points}
%Let $p(t), q(t)$ be analytic functions (ie, they admit power series
%representations).
Differential equations of the form
\be
\label{singode}
y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y=0
\ee
can behave poorly at $t=0$, and may not admit solutions of the form
$y(t) =\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^n$. However, we can still solve these problem
by modifying the series expansion. The easiest case is when the singular
point is a regular singular point, for which we use \emph{the method of
Froebenius}.

The point $t=0$ is a \emph{singular point} if either
$\lim_{t \rightarrow 0}p(t)=\infty$ or  $lim_{t \rightarrow 0}q(t)=\infty$.

The point $t=0$ is a \emph{regular singular point} of \eqref{singode} if
the two limits $\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} t p(t) =p_0$
and $\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} t^2 q(t) =q_0$
exist and are finite. Series solutions at regular singular points are of the
form
\be
\boxed{y(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^{n+r}},
\ee
for some $r\in\mathbb{C}$ such that $a_0 \neq 0$.

Since we now have one more variable for which to solve (i.e.\ $r$ in addition
to $a_0, a_1,\dots$), we require one more equation in order to determine the
solution uniquely. Then if we take the first and second derivative of
$y(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^{n+r}$ and put them into the left-hand side of
equation \eqref{singode}, we can see that the
leading-order (which is to say the $t^{r-2}$) coefficient is
\bee
a_0 r(r-1)t^{r-2} + a_0 \frac{p_0}{t} r t^{r-1} + a_0 \frac{q_0}{t^2} t^r
\eee
In order to satisfy equation \eqref{singode}, this equation must equal $0$.
We can multiply by $t^2$ and since $a_0 \neq 0$, we see that
\be
\boxed{\implies r(r-1) + p_0 r  + q_0=0}.
\ee
This is called the \emph{indicial equation}. It's a quadratic so it has two
solutions, $r=r_1,r_2$.

If we have two distinct roots with $Re(r_1) > Re(r_2)$, we're fine, and we
have two linearly independent solutions
\be
\boxed{y_1(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^{n+r_1}}
\quad\mbox{  and  }\quad
\boxed{y_2(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n t^{n+r_2}}.
\ee
If $r_1=r_2$, then our solutions are
\be
\boxed{y_1(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^{n+r_1}}
\quad\mbox{  and  }\quad
\boxed{y_2(t) = \ln(t) y_1(t) + \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n t^{n+r_1}}.
\ee
If $r_1-r_2$ is an integer, then we have yet another possibility, i.e.\ that
\be
\boxed{y_1(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^{n+r_1}}
\quad\mbox{  and  }\quad
\boxed{y_2(t) = C\ln(t) y_1(t) + \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n t^{n+r_1}},
\ee
for some constant $C\in\mathbb{R}$.

Once one has determined $r_1$ and $r_2$, the constants $a_n$ and $b_n$ can
be determined by matching powers as per the previous section.

  Consider Bessel's equation,

}{
  We can divide Bessel's equation by $t^2$ to get it in the form of
  \eqref{singode}, that is
  \bee
  y''  + \frac{1}{t}y' + \(1-\frac{\alpha^2}{t^2}\)y=0,
  \eee
  which is clearly singular. We can identify $p=1/t$, and
  $q=1-\frac{\alpha^2}{t^2}$. Then,
  \bee
  p_0 = \lim_{t\rightarrow 0} t p(t) =1, \quad \text{and}\quad
  q_0 = \lim_{t\rightarrow 0} t^2 q(t) =-\alpha^2.
  \eee
  The indicial equation is then
  $r(r-1) +r -\alpha^2 =0 \implies r_{1,2} = \pm \alpha$.  Thus,

  y_1'' &=& \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (n+\alpha)(n+\alpha-1)t^{n+\alpha-2}.

  Putting this into \eqref{bessel}, we have
  \bee
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\[(n+\a)(n+\a-1) + (n+\a) - \a^2  \]t^{n+\alpha}

  \eee
  The $a_0$ and $a_1$ terms are determined by initial conditions. For

  \bee
  a_n\[\(n+\a\)^2 - \a^2\]t^{n+\alpha}  + a_{n-2} t^{n+\alpha}=0

  which implies that
  \bee
  a_n = \frac{-a_{n-2}}{\(n+\a\)^2 - \a^2} =  \frac{-a_{n-2}}{n(n+ 2\a)}.
  \eee
  Associating $y_1$ with $a_0=1$ and $a_1=0$, we can set $n=2m$, so the
  recursion relationship is
  \be
  a_{2m} = \frac{-a_{2(m-1)}}{2m (2m+2\a)} = \frac{-a_{2(m-1)}}{2^2m (m+\a)}.
  \ee
  Solving the recursion relationship then yields
  \be
  a_{2m} = \frac{(-1)^ma_0}{2^{2m}m! (m+\a)(m+\a-1)\dots(1+\a)}.

  The solution is then
  \be
  \label{bessel1}
  y_1 = \sum_{m=0}^\infty
  \frac{(-1)^m}{2^{2m}m! (m+\a)(m+\a-1)\dots(1+\a)(\a)} t^{m+\alpha}.  \qed
  \ee
We can simplify this a little by setting $a_0=1/(2^\a\G(\a+1))$. Then we would
get the standard form of Bessel's function of the first kind of order $\a$,
  \bee
  J_\alpha(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!\G(1-\a+n)}
  \(\frac{t}{2}\)^{2n-\a}.

Here $\G(x)$ is called the Gamma function and it is just an extension of the
factorial function. So in particular, when $\alpha=0$, we get

  J_0(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n t^{2n}}{2^{2n}(n!)^2}.

% Too messy and complicated- fixed above

\chapter{Partial Differential Equations}
Let $y(x,t)$ be the temperature of a one-dimensional rod with thermal
conductivity $k$. The equation that describes the evolution of $y$ is
called the heat equation:
\bee
\pp{y}{t} =  k\pptwo{y}{x}.
\eee
This is an important example of a partial differential equation (PDE), in which
the derivatives with respect to one variable are related to derivatives with
respect to another variable, in this case $\partial/\partial t$ and
$\partial/\partial x$.

The basic technique for solving partial differential equations is to transform
it into an ordinary differential equation, which we can then solve using any
of the techniques that we have discussed so far. One very powerful technique
to do this is to transform the function $y$ into a \emph{Fourier series}.

\section{Separation of Variables}
As in the previous section, we use a series solution for $y$ and expand around
 $x=0$. However, instead of the coefficients being constant, we allow them to
be functions of time, and, instead of using $x^n$, we let $X_n(x)$ be a more
general function of $x$. That is, we let
\be
\boxed{y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty T_n(t) X_n(x)}.
\ee
As you will see in the next lab, we can choose the functions $X_n$ in a way
that makes the PDE solvable. For now, let's consider the case where the $X_n$
are either sine or cosine, i.e.\ when $y$ is a Fourier sine or cosine series.

\section{Fourier Cosine and Sine Series}
Consider functions that are periodic with period $2T$.
If we set $X_n =\cos(n \pi x/T)$, we have the \emph{Fourier cosine series} for
$f(x)$,
\bee
\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos\(\frac{n \pi x}{T}\)
\eee
(note the annoying $1/2$ on the first term). Setting $X_n=\sin(n \pi x/T)$,
we get the \emph{Fourier sine series} for $f(x)$,
\bee
\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin\(\frac{n \pi x}{T}\)
\eee
The coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ are determined by integration, with
\be\label{fouriercoeff}
\boxed{a_n = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T}^T f(x) \cos\(\frac{n \pi x}{T}\) \, dx},
\quad \text{and} \quad
\boxed{b_n = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T}^T f(x) \sin\(\frac{n \pi x}{T}\) \, dx}.
\ee
More generally, the \emph{Fourier series} for $f(x)$ is the sum of these, i.e.\
\bee
\boxed{\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \[ a_n \cos\(\frac{n \pi x}{T}\)
+ b_n \sin\(\frac{n \pi x}{T}\) \]}.
\eee
Often, we just look at functions that have period $2\pi$, which makes for the
simpler formulae,
\be\label{nicefourier}
&&\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \[ a_n \cos\(nx\)
+ b_n \sin\(nx\) \] ;
\\ \nonumber
&&a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) \cos\(n x\) \, dx,
\\ \nonumber
&&b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) \sin\(n x\) \, dx,
\ee
which we will refer to as ``the'' Fourier series, unless otherwise stated.


Well, now we have yet another series that we can derive from a given function,
but we have to show that the series converges to the function if we
want to do anything useful. For this we have the following lemma:
\begin{theorem}[Riemann-Lebesque lemma]
If $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \abs{f(x)} dx$ exists, then
\be
\lim_{z\rightarrow \pm \infty}\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) e^{izx} dx =0
\ee
which implies that
\bee
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n =0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} b_n =0,
\eee
and
\bee
f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \[ a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx) \].
\eee
%FIXME: should the limits of integration be $(-\pi,\pi)$ for the series (as
%opposed to the transform)? Also, uniqueness?
\end{theorem}

The Fourier series is the expression of a function as the sum an infinite series
of waves with different amplitudes. That is, we transform from ``$x$-space'' to
``frequency-space'', which can be incredibly useful. For example, the
\texttt{Ogg Vorbis} audio format is just a modified cosine-series. Fourier
series (and Fourier transforms, which are not covered in this course) lie at
the heart of signal analysis. In terms of solving PDEs, we make use of the
fact that
\bee
\ddtwo{}{x}\sin(nx) = -n^2 \sin(nx),
\eee
(i.e.\ that sine is an Eigenfunction of $\ddtwo{}{x}$) to turn differential
equations into algebraic equations. But more on that later. First, let's just
find the Fourier series for a normal function.

\workedexample{
Find the Fourier series of
\bee
f(x) = x
\eee
}{
To find the Fourier series, we just need to determine $a_n$ and $b_n$ using
equation~\eqref{nicefourier}. The coefficients for the cosine series are
\bee
a_n &=& \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi x \cos(nx)\, dx
\\\nonumber
&=& \frac{1}{\pi}\[ \left.x \frac{\sin(nx)}{n} \right|_{-\pi}^{\pi}
-\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\sin(nx)}{n}\, dx \]
\\\nonumber
&=& \frac{1}{\pi}
\[0 - \frac{1}{n^2}\left. \cos(nx) \right|_{-\pi}^{\phantom{-}\pi} \] =0.
\eee
This could have been expected, since $f(x)=x$ is an odd function, and $\cos(nx)$
is even, and the integration domain is symmetric. Notice, then, that the
cosine series of a function is equal to the even part of the function. Now,
for the sine series, we have
\bee
b_n &=& \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi x \sin(nx)\, dx
\\\nonumber
&=& \frac{1}{\pi} \[ \left.\frac{-x\cos(nx)}{n}\right|_{-\pi}^\pi
                    - \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{-\cos(nx)}{n}\, dx  \]
\\\nonumber
&=& \frac{1}{\pi}\[\frac{-\pi\cos(\pi n)}{n} - \frac{-\pi\cos(-n\pi)}{n} -0 \]
\\\nonumber
&=& \frac{1}{\pi}\[\frac{-2\pi}{n}\cos(n \pi)\]
\\\nonumber
&=&\frac{-2 (-1)^n}{n} = (-1)^{n+1}\frac{2}{n}.
\eee
The Fourier series for $f(x)=x$ is then
\be
\label{Fourierx}
x = 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty  \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \sin(nx). \qed
\ee
This does indeed converge to $f(x)=x$ around $x=0$, as can be seen in
figure~\ref{fourierx}.

\chapter{Partial Differential Equations:
         \\Actually Solving Them}

Let us now return to the heat equation,
\be
\label{heateq}
\pp{y}{t} = \beta \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2},
\ee
and add some \emph{initial conditions}
\bee
y(x,0)=f(x),
\eee
and \emph{boundary conditions}
\be
\label{homdibc}
y(0,t)=0, \qquad y(\pi,t)=0.
\ee
Physically, this corresponds to modelling the temperature on a rod of length
$2\pi$ in contact at both ends with a heat sink with temperature $0$ (note
that this is not necessarily absolute zero: if we take $y=y+C$, the equation
remains the same, so our base temperature is arbitrary.) The
rod starts with the temperature at position $x$ given by $f(x)$.

We'll solve this using separation of variables:
\be\label{heatF}
y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty T_n(t) X_n(x),
\ee
where we have taken $X_n(x)$ to be orthogonal\footnote{That is, if $n\neq m$,
then $\int_0^\pi X_n(x) X_m(x) dx =0.$ This is the case with elements of
$\{\cos(nx),\sin(nx),n=0,1,\dots \}$.}.
Putting equation \eqref{heatF} into equation \eqref{heateq}, we get
\be\label{heats}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \ddt{T_n(t)}X_n(x)
=\beta\sum_{n=0}^\infty T_n(t)\ddtwo{X_n(x)}{x}
\ee
Now, since the $X_n$'s are orthogonal, this actually holds term-by-term. That
is, for each $n$, we have
\bee
T_n'(t)X_n(x) = \beta  T_n(t)X_n''(x)
\quad \implies \quad
\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{T_n'(t)}{T_n(t)}= \frac{X_n''(x)}{X_n(x)}.
\eee
Now, the LHS is independent of $x$, so the RHS must also be independent of $x$.
Since the RHS is also clearly independent of $t$, it must be constant. That is,
\bee
\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{T_n'(t)}{T_n(t)}= \frac{X_n''(x)}{X_n(x)} = K_n,
\eee
where $K_n$ can only depend on $n$.

This gives us an ODE for $X_n$,
\be
\label{Eigenfunction}
X_n'' = K_n X_n.
\ee
Now, depending on the sign of $K_n$, we have three possibilities, which we will
deal with by enforcing the boundary conditions. Since the $X_n$ are orthogonal,
the boundary conditions must be satisfied for each $n$. The cases are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $K_n=k_n^2 > 0$. In this case, $X_n(x)= C_1 e^{k_n x} +C_2 e^{-k_n x}$.
    But then, $X_n(0)=0$ and $X_n(\pi)=0$ imply that $C_1=C_2=0$, so $X_n=0$ in
    this case.
  \item $K_n = 0$. In this case, we get $X_n(x)=Ax +B$. Again, the boundary
    conditions imply that $A=B=0$, so $X_n=0$ in this case.
  \item $K_n =-k_n^2 < 0$. This gives us periodic behaviour,
    \bee
    X_n(x)=C_1\cos(k_nx) + C_2\sin(k_nx).
    \eee
    We require that $X_n(0)=C_1=0$, so we can remove all the cosines. The
    other boundary condition gives us
    \bee
    X_n(\pi)=C_2\sin(k_n\pi)=0,
    \eee
    which implies that either $C_2=0$ or $k_n$ is an integer. Since this is
    our last chance to have $X_n$ not be zero everywhere, we can't have $C_2=0$,
    so we set $k_n$ to be an integer. In particular, set $k_n=n$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, $K_n=-n^2$, and $X_n= \sin(nx)$. Much simpler!

We now have enough information to start determining $T_n$. We know that
$K_n=-n^2$, so $T_n$ obeys the equation
\bee
T_n' = \beta K_n T_n = - \beta n^2 T_n
\qquad \implies \qquad
T_n = T_n(0) e^{-\beta n^2 t}.
\eee

Putting this together, our solution (so far) is
\bee
y(x,t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty T_n(0) e^{-\beta n^2 t} \sin(nx).
\eee
To get this, we have used the original equation and the boundary conditions.
We still have to determine the values of $T_n(0)$, for which we will use the
initial conditions, $y(x,0)=f(x)$. That is,
\bee
y(x,0)=f(x) =  \sum_{n=0}^\infty T_n(0) e^{-\beta n^2 t} \sin(nx)
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty T_n(0) \sin(nx).
\eee
In other words, this is just a sine-series for $f(x)$! However, instead of
integrating over $(-\pi,\pi)$, we only know $f(x)$ for $x\in(0,\pi)$. We can
solve this problem by extending $f(x)$ as an odd function by setting
$f(-x)=-f(x)$, so the coefficients are given by
\bee
T_n(0)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x)\sin(nx)dx
=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(nx)dx,
\eee
since the integrand is even.

The solution to the heat equation is then
\be
\boxed{
y(x,t)=\frac{2}{\pi}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \[\int_0^\pi f(x)\sin(nx)\,dx\]
e^{-kn^2t}
\sin(nx)}.
\ee

\workedexample{
  The initial temperature in a rod of length $\pi$ is given by

  \label{heat1ic}

  \bee
  \pp{y}{t} = \beta \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2},
  \eee
  find $y(x,t)$ for $x\in(0,\pi)$, $t>0$.
  }\\
{
  The boundary conditions match those given in equation \eqref{homdibc}, so
  the above analysis shows that we can express $y$ as a linear combination
  of $\{\sin(nx),n=1,2,\dots\}$. That is,
  \bee
  y(x,t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty T_n(0) e^{-\b n^2 t} \sin(nx).
  \eee
  The initial conditions are that $y(x,0)=2\sin(x)+\sin(5x)$, so $T_1(0)=2$,
  $T_5(0)=1$, and all others are zero. We can then write the solution as
  \bee
  y(x,t) = 2 e^{-\b t} \sin(x) + e^{-25 \b t} \sin(5x).
  \eee
%FIXME: Is this enough explanation?
 This result is shown for various times in figure \ref{heat1} for $\b=1$.

\section{Non-homogeneous constant boundary conditions}

Suppose that the boundary conditions were instead
\bee
y(0,t)=A, \qquad y(\pi,t)=B.
\eee
Notice that these conditions match the case $K_n=0$ with
\bee
y(x,t)=\frac{B-A}{\pi}x+A.
\eee
This obeys the heat equation, since
\bee
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(mx+b)=0= \pp{}{t}(mx+b),
\eee
and is independent of $t$, i.e.\ it is a steady state solution. Then, setting
\bee
g(x) = f(x) - \(A+ \frac{B-A}{\pi}x\),
\eee
\be
\label{diribc}
y(x,t)=A + \frac{B-A}{\pi}x +
\frac{2}{\pi}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty\(\int_{0}^\pi g(x)\sin(nx)dx\) e^{-\b n^2t} \sin(nx)
\ee
matches both the initial and boundary conditions.

  \eee
  for $y(x,t)$.

}{
  The steady-state solution is $x+1$. Let
  \bee
  g(x) = f(x) -(x+1) = x^2
  \eee
  Then,
  \bee
  y(x,t) = 1 + x + \sum_{n=1}^\infty T_n(0) e^{-\b n^2 t} \sin(nx).
  \eee
  And in order to satisfy $y(x,0)=1+x+x^2$, we have
  \bee
  x^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty T_n(0) \sin(nx).
  \eee
  The coefficients are given by the formula
  \bee
  T_n(0) &=& \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi x^2 \sin(nx) \, dx
  \\\nonumber
  &=& \frac{2}{\pi}\[\left.x^2 \frac{-\cos(nx)}{n} \right|_0^\pi
  + \frac{2}{n}\int_0^\pi x \cos(nx)dx\]
  \\\nonumber

  The solution is therefore

\section{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Show that equation \eqref{diribc} does indeed solve the heat equation
    with the given boundary and initial conditions.
  \item
    An inanimate carbon rod of length $\pi$ is hit with a ``laser'',
    transferring an amount of heat $H$ to a point at its centre. That is, the
    initial temperature distribution along its length is given by
    \bee
    y(x,0)=H\delta\(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\).
    \eee
    If the ends of the rod are kept at constant temperature $0$, and the
    temperature in the rod obeys the relationship
    \bee
    \pp{y}{t} = \beta \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2},
    \eee
    find $y(x,t)$ for all $t\geq 0$.
    \hidesolution{
      Following the above procedure,
      \bee
      y(x,t)=\frac{2}{\pi}

    \emph{Neumann boundary conditions} specify the value of the function at
    the boundary, e.g. $y(0,t)=A$, $y(\pi,t)=B$ with $A$ and $B$ constant.
    We showed that the set of Eigenfunctions given by equation
    \eqref{Eigenfunction} must be $\{\sin(nx),n=1,2,\dots\}$ in this case.
    If the boundary conditions were instead \emph{Dirichlet boundary conditions}
    such as
    \bee
    \left.\pp{y(x,t)}{x}\right|_{x=0}=0, \qquad
        \left.\pp{y(x,t)}{x}\right|_{x=\pi}=0,
